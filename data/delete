You must delete all relationship first in delete other wise it throws error 
if you use detach delete it automatically delete the node with relationship

create (a:Person{name:"jhon alex",age:20})
create (m:Movie{name:"Jesus Movie"})
create (a)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)
WITH a ,m
match (a:Person{name:"jhon alex",age:20})
detach delete a
